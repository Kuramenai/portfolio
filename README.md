## Projects
### [PathGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05846): An Application of Large Language Models on the Path Recommendation Problem
Research on the understanding and application of LLMs to path recommendation, a core service of many navigation systems. We also tried to improve their performance through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Ollama was used to deploy the LLM Qwen-2.5-14b-instruct locally, chromaDB for the vector database, and multilingual-e5-large as the embedding model. The research article is available at the following address: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05846.
